My name's is Peter Nylander and I'm a software engineer and a solution architect!

I have been working with software development for over 20 years. 
I have worked with many different technologies and platforms, but I have always had a passion for Microsoft technologies. 

On this blog I will write about my thoughts and ideas about software development and architecture. I will also share some of my projects and code snippets and what I have learned from on the way. I hope you will find something interesting here and that you will come back for more!
